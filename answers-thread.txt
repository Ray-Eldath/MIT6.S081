when two threads trying to insert elements into the same bucket:
1. if two keys are different, one thread will update the head by `*p = e` first, and 
    if this concurrent with another update, the latter update will overwrites the 
    former, cause a lost update. and inline `insert` could make critical section
    only contains two writes.
2. when two keys are the same, there's no need to lock since one update will
    overwrites the other whatsoever.
